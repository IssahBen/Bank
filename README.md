You went to the village with your family after having not visited in a long time. 
Being ever so proud you, your parents hyped your 'IT'/Tech skills your extended family and anyone who would listen.
The timing couldn't have been better for your one of your uncles who also happened to be the head of the village's cooperative credit union. He recently discovered a competing credit union just deployed digital solutions for their operations. He'd like to do the same for his credit union instead still relying on the current paper and pen process.

Now, he wants you to design and build the solution. You need to build a digital banking solution that solves the peculiar needs of this cooperative union's customer base who are largely unbanked and underbanked.
